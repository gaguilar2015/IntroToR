# IntroToR
This is a project started in early 2020 and to be continued. The original aim was to provide friend and colleagues with a gentle introduction to the R programming language for data and statistical analysis.

This repository is the source for [this website](https://gaguilar2015.github.io/IntroToR/), which was built using the Bookdown package which allows for the creation of websites using R and RMarkdown.

The guide introduces the R environment and R studio, and provides a brief foray into the Tidyverse for data wrangling. 

When time permits, I will want to continue this project because I am a firm believer in th beauty and power of R.
